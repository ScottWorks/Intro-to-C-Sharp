## Program Structure

- **Programs** consist of one or more source files which declare **types** that contain **members** that are organized into **namespaces**.

  - Types - Classes and interfaces.
  - Memebers - Fields, methods, properties, and events.
  - Assemblies - Compiled files that are packages as either an `.exe` (application) or `.dll` (library).

- Assemblies contain executable code in the form of Intermediate Language (IL) instructions. Before it is executed, the IL code in an assembly (`.exe` or `.dll`) is automatically converted to code by the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.

## Types and Variables

- Value types:
  - Simple types:
    - Signed/ Unsigned Intergral
    - Unicode characters
    - Boolean
    - Floating point
    - Decimal
  - Enums
  - Structs - is similar to a class type in that it represents a structure with data members and function members. However, unlike classes, structs are value types and do not typically require heap allocation. Struct types do not support user-specified inheritance, and all struct types implicitly inherit from type object
  - Nullable values
- Reference types:
  - Classes
    - Objects
    - String
    - Class - defines a data structure that contains data members (fields) and function members (methods, properties, and others). Class types support single inheritance and polymorphism, mechanisms whereby derived classes can extend and specialize base classes.
  - Interfaces - defines a contract as a named set of public function members. A class or struct that implements an interface must provide implementations of the interfaceâ€™s function members. An interface may inherit from multiple base interfaces, and a class or struct may implement multiple interfaces.
  - Arrays
  - Delegates - represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type. Delegates make it possible to treat methods as entities that can be assigned to variables and passed as parameters. Delegates are analogous to function types provided by functional languages. They are also similar to the concept of function pointers found in some other languages, but unlike function pointers, delegates are object-oriented and type-safe.
